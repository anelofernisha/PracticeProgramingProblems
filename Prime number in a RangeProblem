String Printing Problems

Problem 6: Prime Numbers in a Range 🌟

Goal: Write a program that takes two integers, L (lower bound) and U (upper bound), and prints all prime numbers within that range (inclusive). A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
Input Example: L: 10, U: 30
Expected Output: 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29
Key Concepts:
Nested Loops (Outer loop iterates through the range, inner loop checks for primality).
Conditional Statements (to check divisibility and handle the number 1 and 2).
Optimization (e.g., checking divisors only up to the square root of the number).

var L : Int = 1
var U :Int = 30

for number in L...U {

    if number <= 1 {
    
        continue
        
    }

    var Primenum = true

    for i in 2..<number {
    
        if number % i == 0 {
        
            Primenum = false
            
            break   
        }
    }

      if Primenum == true{
    
          print(number, terminator:" ")
        
    }
}
