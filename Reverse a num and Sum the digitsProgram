String Printing Problems
‌
Problem 4: FizzBuzz Variation with Range 🚀
‌
Goal: Write a program that takes two integers as input: a starting number and an ending number. The program should iterate from the start number to the end number (inclusive) and print the following:
Print "Code" if the number is divisible by 3.
Print "Nerd" if the number is divisible by 5.
Print "CodeNerd" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
Otherwise, print the number itself.
Input Example: Start: 1, End: 15
Expected Output (partial):
1
2
Code
4
Nerd
Code
...
14
CodeNerd
Key Concepts:
Loops (for generating the sequence of numbers).
Modulo Operator ($\%$ for checking divisibility).
Nested Conditionals (The "CodeNerd" check must be first).

var numbers : Int = 20

for number in 1...numbers {

    if number % 3 == 0 && number % 5 == 0 {
    
    	print("CodeNerd")

	}else if number % 3 == 0 {
    
    	print("Code")
    
    }else if number % 5 == 0 {
    
    	print("Nerd")
    
    }else {
    
    	print(number)
